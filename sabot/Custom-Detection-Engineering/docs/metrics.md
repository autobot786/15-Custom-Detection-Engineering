# Metrics Template (Real-world, Resume-safe)

Replace the example numbers with your actual outcomes.

## Signal Quality
- Alerts/day: **X → Y** after tuning
- False positives/day: **X → Y**
- Precision (estimated): **X%**

## Response Efficiency
- MTTA: **X min**
- MTTR: **X hrs**
- Playbook usage rate: **X%**

## Coverage
- Data sources: Authentication, Endpoint, DNS/Proxy, Email, IAM, VPN
- MITRE techniques covered: 15 detections (see `docs/mitre_mapping.md`)

## Example (replace)
- Reduced false positives by **38%** after allowlisting VPN egress and baselining admin tooling.
- Improved MTTR by **22%** using standardized containment steps for account compromise and ransomware indicators.
